            didnt want to create a fancy website so instead here are some videos of my projects and descriptions accompanying them.

                I was making this physics engine using roblox multithreading and eventually gave up on it. I was gonna use it for the game knockout thats right below this box but the lag was too much and the network cost was also pretty expensive. Overall i learned quite a bit about roblox multithreading but the collisions were and still are impossible to find it, its pretty simple in 2d but as soon as you add that 3rd dimension everything starts burning. Thats mainly why i quit on this after spending like 3 weeks trying to figure out the contact manifold.

                Game i was working on called knockout. This game was heavily inspired by gangbeasts if you know what that is but altogether it took me like 2 months to get a playable and polished version. Mainly because this was my first like complex project and it involved a LOT of scripting. It was fun to work on but since all of the character controller code was held server side the input delay was like 100ms on average with interpolation. There was really no fix to this as client prediction would be almost impossible to implement. I mainly stopped working on this after I figured out that just 1 character was already sending 100kbs of data which is twice robloxs limit. This game is also mainly where I learned how to create effective and good lookingish ui.

                This was after knockout and after I took like a 1 month break from roblox dev. Coming back I wanted to create some kind of build a boat system but more refined polished and with features i would have dreamed of when I used to play it. I only really spent like 3 weeks on this and had a good bit of fun creating it, it has a cool concept and I think i might still pursue this game as it has some potential when compared to knockout. There are a bunch of features and I optimized it really well. One thing im not really proud of is the ui, you can see how inconsistant it is and thats because each tool/menu i was experimenting with different designs because it all just kind of looked bad to me. Either way super happy with this one.

            thats about all, I could write a LOT more about each project like all of the different things i tried and all of the other features but i wanted to keep this portfolio relatively short. I have other projects on the side too but i think these will do.
